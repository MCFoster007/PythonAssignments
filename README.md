Throughout this Introduction to Programming course, I used Python.  It was an addition to other languages I learned.  In this course, I wrote journals on the concepts I learned and completed two projects.  The projects were a basic calculator and the scenario I chose, Financial Planner.  I built off the starter code and added unittests along with a storage file to hold all the data.  This course challenged me in every way possible, but I gained knowledge that will assist me in my future career.  I appreciate the resources presented, our instructor, and the SNHU tutoring team.  Thank you all! Ciao, MC
